# Adding a New User

The `addUser.php` script provisions a seedbox account with the required quota and rTorrent settings.

```
Usage: addUser.php USERNAME PASSWORD MAX_RTORRENT_MEMORY_IN_MB DISK_QUOTA_IN_GB [trafficLimitGB]
```

Arguments:
- **USERNAME** – login name to create
- **PASSWORD** – set the initial password (use `rand` for a random password)
- **MAX_RTORRENT_MEMORY_IN_MB** – memory limit applied to rTorrent
- **DISK_QUOTA_IN_GB** – storage quota
- **trafficLimitGB** (optional) – monthly traffic cap

Usernames are normalised to lowercase and must match `[a-z][a-z0-9]{0,7}`—a
leading letter followed by up to seven lowercase letters or digits. This keeps
Unix account names predictable for admins and avoids shell injection edge cases
elsewhere in the tooling.

On success the script:
- creates the Unix user and home directory
- assigns an HTTP service port via `portManager.php`
- writes rTorrent/ruTorrent configuration
- enables quotas and traffic limits
- starts rTorrent and lighttpd

Example:

```
/scripts/addUser.php alice rand 512 100 500
```

This adds user `alice` with a random password, 512 MB rTorrent limit, 100 GB disk quota and a 500 GB monthly traffic limit.

**Documentation quality**: The script itself is largely uncommented and could benefit from a more detailed explanation of the setup steps performed.
